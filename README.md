# Password Generator Challenge
Password Generator Challenge

Description

Per acceptance criteria and mockup, the requested functionality has been coded on to the Password Generator so that users can generate randomized password to their desired character length and incorporating their desired character types. The character types include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special symbols, and numbers. Additionally, validation rules have been included to ensure that when picking a length, the value entered is numeric, and when selecting a character type, that at least one criteria has been selected.
